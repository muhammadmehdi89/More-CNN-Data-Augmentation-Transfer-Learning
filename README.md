Project Overview: Applying Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning with TensorFlow and Keras

Welcome to our data augmentation and transfer learning project! This repository demonstrates the implementation of essential machine learning techniques using TensorFlow and Keras. We focus on enhancing model performance through data augmentation, a process that generates diverse training samples, and transfer learning, a powerful method leveraging pre-trained models. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this project provides practical insights, code examples, and guidelines to help you seamlessly integrate these techniques into your own projects.
